# MarchingSquares
Marching squares algorithm done in processing java


Marching squares is a computer graphics algorithm that generates contours for a two-dimensional scalar field (rectangular array of individual numerical values). A similar method can be used to contour 2D triangle meshes.

A grid of squares is generated. each corner of the square is given a random number(0 or 1) and based on the configuration shown below the lines are drawn.
